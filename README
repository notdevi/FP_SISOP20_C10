1)xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
2)Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
3)but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

12)xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
13)    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
14)    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
15)    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
16)    NetBSD (console.c)

ERROR REPORTS

We switched our focus to xv6 on RISC-V; see the mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git
repository on github.com.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
